# Heavily modified for Slackware by Jeremy Brent Hansen <jebrhansen -at- gmail.com>
#
# NOTE: This won't work in Slackware 14.0 and earlier due to the OS lacking numfmt. It was
# introduced in the coreutils package in 14.1.
#
# Changelog
#
# 2016/07/07 - Updated MIRRORS variable to use EOF for easier copy/paste
# 2016/05/28 - Added additional comments for github upload
# 2015/11/06 - Initial release of slack-mirror-speedtest.sh

# Add or change mirrors from /etc/slackpkg/mirrors as desired (these are the US mirrors)
# Just place them between the read line and the EOF at the end. No quotes are necessary
read -r -d '' MIRRORS << 'EOF'
