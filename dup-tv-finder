# This script is used to detect multiple instances of TV show episodes.
# Currently, it ignores any srt (subtitle) files, but it does pick up other,
# possibly desired, extensions, such as nfo and sub. Be congnizant of that 
# when you look at your results. This does expect that your shows are labeled
# using a folder for the show, and within there, individual folders for each
# season (the naming scheme of those shouldn't matter), and that your
# episodes use the "Showname - SXXEXX - Episodename" format.
# (e.g. Star Trek/Star Trek - Season 1/Star Trek - S01E01 - The Man Trap.avi)
