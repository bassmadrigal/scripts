# This script will list all movies that have the same title within a directory.
# It does assume that the year is directly after the title and the year is
# enclosed by parenthesis (e.g. Movie Title (2000) extra stuff). It should work
# on a directory filled with other directories containing the movie title or on
# a directory filled with movies files themselves (although, the latter hasn't 
# been tested). When complete, it will print out the movies that have the same 
# name, so you can manually go through and decide whether to keep them. Right
# now, it only looks at movies titles, so if you have movies that have the same
# name, but were made in different years (Oceans 11 -- 1960 and 2001), they
# will both be displayed. I may add a year checker later on.

# Set your movie directory... can be overriden when starting the script.
# (e.g. MOVDIR=/custom/location dup-movie-finder)
MOVDIR=${MOVDIR:-/location/to/movies}
